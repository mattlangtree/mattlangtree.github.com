<div class="entry-content"><p>My plans for the upcoming winter break will be primarily concerned with
designing a new Content Management System(CMS) for a<a href="http://www.leadoncairns.com.au/"> local youth
group</a> in Cairns. I created the initial
design for the webpage back in November 2004. I was given one weeks notice to
create a respectable, neat and informative web presence for the group. I came
up with a very static, HTML only, set of pages that briefly described what the
group was about.</p>

<p>With the onset of the christmas holidays i was keen to teach myself some more
about good web design. So i set up my own FreeBSD Server, and put myself
<a href="http://demon.homeunix.net/">online</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I chose demon(.homeunix.net) because it was debated on a video of an
american geek show as to how you say the name of the furry FreeBSD devil
mascot.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is it “demon” or “daemon”. Well daemon.homeunix.net was already take at the
<a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">DNS name registar</a> so “demon” would have to suffice.
And daemon is too hard to spell. <img src="http://demon.homeunix.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" /></p>

<p>I installed PHP and MySQL on the server, and went about teaching myself some
PHP web design. The typical “Hello World” and phpinfo() pages were created,
and i slowly moved onto database insertion and deletion.</p>

<p>I must stop at this point to say that during this time an invaluable tool was
<a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin.</a></p>

<p>I then took a rather large step, and decided to design my own “phpBB style”
messaging system. I got the functionality of pages working, but it just needed
more on the aesthetic side to make it even vaguely useful. Plus, the whole
system consisted of 3 files which were riddled with copied and pasted code. By
immersing myself in a considerable amount of new topics it forced me to assume
certain things before i had learnt about them properly, each and individually.
One of my main assumptions was that there was still quite a considerable
amount of staticness(if thats even a word) in PHP. This was because i assumed
that there were no facilities for implementing functions or classes or
different data types.</p>

<p>I soon ironed these misconceptions out, when i read through the source code
for Mambo - a popular Web Content Management System. I realised that there
were such things as classes and functions and the way that i was accessing the
MySQL database before wasn’t just a bizarre collection of steps that needed to
be followed to access the database.</p>

<p>[January, 2005]</p>

<p>I spent about a week customising Mambo and even offered to help redesign the
new www.fnqgl.com website. Although i didn’t follow through on this, as i had
heaps more to learn about FreeBSD in the remainder of my holidays. At this
stage, i was running my web server on a Pentium 3 500, and although this was
doing a good job at serving web pages, it was taking hours and hours to
compile the Java SDK/JDK (1.4). It was just plain slow in my opinion. So i
went out and bought myself a whole new system to run my webserver. That being:</p>

<ul>
<li>AMD Sempron 2500+(shaddup andrew!)</li>
<li>512Mb DDR-400 RAM</li>
<li>Asus Mobo.
I had a few spare hard drives hanging around, and my brother had just bought a
new 120Gb SATA drive that wouldn’t plug into his P3 800 Mobo with only IDE
ports. So instead of taking it back, I convinced him of the prospect of having
our own home server, and so he gave me the SATA drive and he went and bought
another drive(this time IDE ).</li>
</ul>


<p>I installed FreeBSD 5.3 on this new system, as this is what i had on the old
system, and i had knowledge and experience of FBSD5.3 working, without any
noticable bugs.</p>

<p>[May 2005]</p>

<p>In Early May 2005 I joined the FreeBSD Java Mailing List. This was an
opportunity for me to fill my mailbox with useless(although perhaps
educational) mail. Well it is better than spam! Around this time I started to
play around with the recent Alpha version of Suns JDK/SDK 1.5. FreeBSDs native
java1.5 implementation was very buggy, to the point of it being still in the
process of it being ported over. So i opted for the Sun-Linux version of the
JDK. After installing Java1.4 first(it’s a prerequisite) I finally got the 1.5
working. The main reason for installing jdk1.5 is so that i could run netbeans
4.0 on the system, for my JCU CP3120 project. This is where i hit a
brickwall(although somewhat soft and squiggy…and only knee-high). I have had
no success with updating my portage tree in FreeBSD so far…Wait…let me correct
that..</p>

<p>I haven’t sat down for long enough to learn how to update my portage tree in
FreeBSD.</p>

<p>I swear, it is as easy as adding/modifying a few lines in a simple config
file. But, i must be too lazy. All this work with Unix and PHP and MySQL has
payed off for me this semester. The first assignment in my CP2377:Portable
Programming class was a Shell Script Assignment. I have to thank Nick for his
initial help with learning Linux for my success in that assignment. The second
assignment was to create a PHP page for extracting timetable information from
a CELCAT generated HTML page. I can attribute my initial interest in PHP to my
foundation understanding of this assignment. Although, as this assignment
relied heavily on string manipulation andI was relatively new to regular
expressions, I didn’t do as well as i would have liked.</p>

<p>Moving closer to the present time, I have finished all my exams</p>

<p>I have left alot of my social life unwritten, partly because there is a severe
lack thereof, when you are infatuated with learning new things about
computers(i.e - a nerd). And partly because it would make other nerds jealous,
the fun times that i did have. (i.e - birthday party with real girls and that
highly intoxicating drinking game i learnt on the night NSW beat QLD in the
state of origin)</p>

<p>I had intended this to be a whole heap longer than what it is, but i started
to get bored about 10 lines in.</p>
