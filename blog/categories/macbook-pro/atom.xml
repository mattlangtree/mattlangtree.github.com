    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I called up apple support asking them if I could choose a non-glossy
display for the MacBook Pro (MBP) 17" that I wanted to order from the Mac
Refurbished store.</p>

<p><a href="http://mattlangtree.github.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2008/07/design_display_17led20080226.jpg"><img src="/images/wp-content/2008/07/design_display_17led20080226-300x166.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The very helpful lady sincerely apologised and said "the glossy and non-glossy
MBPs are all stored in the same spot, and we can't open them to find out which
one we are sending you".</p>

<p>Despite having to brave the possibility of receiving a glossy display, I went
ahead and ordered the MBP 17" rather than taking the risk of ordering from a
random seller on eBay.</p>

<p>So, here is the link to the product that I ordered:
http://store.apple.com/au/product/FA897X/A</p>

<p>2.4Ghz MBP 17" 1680x1050, 5400rpm 160GB HDD(and possibly a glossy or non-
glossy display, it's completely random)</p>

<p>And here is what I got:</p>

<p>2.6Ghz MBP 17" 1920x1200, 7200rpm 200GB w/ Matte display</p>

<p><a href="/images/wp-content/2008/07/img_0226.jpg"><img src="/images/wp-content/2008/07/img_0226-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>As any
nerd would attest, getting a</p>

<p>1) CPU upgrade (2.4 ->2.6) 2) display resolution upgrade (1680x1050 ->
1920x1200) 3) HDD capacity (160GB -> 200GB ) 4) HDD speed upgrade (5400rpm
->7200rpm)</p>

<p>is an extremely lucky surprise.</p>

<p>Just as a side note, every one of those 4 upgrades is an added expense on top
of the base 17" MBP.</p>

<p>I am an extremely happy chappy today. :-)</p>
