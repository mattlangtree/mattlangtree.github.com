  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vodafone today launched a page on their website for registering interest in
the iPhone in Australia. There are still no links to this page from the home
page or the Mobile Phones page on their website.</p>

<p>The pre-registration page for Australian customers wanting to purchase an
iPhone through Vodafone is
<a href="http://store.vodafone.com.au/iphone/">http://store.vodafone.com.au/iphone/</a></p>

<p>Optus has also <a href="http://mattlangtree.com/2008-06-11/optus-vodafone-not-ready-for-iphone.html">released a website</a> for registering interest in the iPhone for
Australian Customers with the option for a $100 deposit to secure an iPhone
when they are released in Australia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Tuesday 10th June at approximately 4am AEST Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple Co.)
announced that the latest 3G version of their popular iPhone will be coming to
Australia on July 11th.</p>

<p>Winning the contract for the iPhone in Australia are Optus and Vodafone.</p>

<p>Optus (the wombat) was quick to poke it&#8217;s head from out of the ground, and has
put up a website for potential Australian customers to send 100 of their hard
earned fully-refundable dollars to show their interest in the cause.</p>

<p>The optusiphone.com.au domain was registered just over a week ago. Optus
Australia have made a slapdash attempt at getting customers excited about the
new iPhone arrival with their banal marketing line &#8220;Get ready to be happy&#8221;.</p>

<p>Potential iPhone customers in Australia can register their interest at the
Optus iPhone website:
<a href="http://www.optusiphone.com.au/">http://www.optusiphone.com.au/</a></p>

<p>Vodafone hasn&#8217;t provided any information about the iPhone on their website
yet. I will update this page when more information comes to light.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early this morning, Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple Co.) announced that the new
iPhone will be available to over 70 countries. On July 11, customers from 25
Countries including Australia, Japan and New Zealand will be able to get their
hands on a new iPhone for the first time. The new iPhone 3G adds features to
the popular iPhone including a new case design, 3G network support and GPS
support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/"><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/hero20080609-300x153.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In Australia, Optus and Vodafone will be carrying the new iPhone 3G, and are
expected to release new plans that will put Australian 3G prices more in line
with 3G prices from countries around the world. AT&amp;T in the US will offer the
iPhone 3G for $199 (8GB Model) and $299 (16GB Model) on a plan. O2 in the UK
is offering the 8GB and 16GB iPhone for free on many of their plans, including
business plans.</p>

<p>As more information about iPhone 3G prices in Australia come to light, we will
be posting them here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On thursday I went to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) to
check out the Game On exhibition.</p>

<p><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/img_gameon_brand.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/mario__sonic_at_the_olympic_games-nintendo_wiiscreenshots10026fencing_lui_tails.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>According to their website &#8220;The Game On exhibition has thrilled more than a
million players of all ages from around the world.&#8221;.</p>

<p>Most of my old favourites were there including Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of
Time [Nintendo 64], 007: GoldenEye [Nintendo 64], Sonic the Hedge Hog [Sega
MegaDrive], and DigDug [Arcade].</p>

<p>The most popular of all the games were the four XBox 360s setup in a
multiplayer square shape all playing Halo 3 on 32&#8221; HD screens, and the two
nintendo Wii&#8217;s connected to 50&#8221; Plasma screens, playing Wii Sports: Tennis and
Mario &amp; Sonic Olympics.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the exhibition were the top ten gaming consoles of
all time - which included the PlayStation, Game Boy, Atari, Commodore 64 and
the Commodore Amiga. They had a dozen fully working arcade machines with games
from asteroids to Dig Dug to Ms Pacman to Street Fighter and a sample of 20+
different fully working hand-held gaming consoles including the Nintendo DS,
Gameboy, Gameboy Advance.</p>

<p><a href="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/steel_battalion7b.jpg"><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/steel_battalion7b-%0A300x244.jpg" alt="MechWarrior Cockpit - ACMI Game On Exhibition" /></a> <a href="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/200607270953_gta3logo.jpg"><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2008/05/200607270953_gta3logo.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Connected to a 3 metre projector screen in the centre of the exhibition was a
fully functional Mechwarrior cockpit. The whole system is quite complicated in
that you are required you to flick 5 switches to engage the system, then you
had to wait for the onscreen power gauges to reach at least 75% before you can
start the ignition. The inverse aim joystick on the 100-ton war machine also
made shooting difficult.</p>

<p>My favourite stall at the exhibition was the original storyboard from the
development of the Grand Theft Auto 3 game. The wall featured a detailed
family tree of all of the missions and 200 lines of the source code used for
when a vehicle blows up. The exhibition is being held at the Australian Centre
for the Moving Image (ACMI) in federation square, Melbourne until Sunday the
13th July. The exhibition is open from 10am-7pm every day and till 9pm on
thursday nights. Full Price is $15 and Concession card holders pay only $10.</p>

<p>You can find out more information about the exhibition at the <a href="http://www.acmi.net.au/game_on.aspx">Australian
Centre for the Moving Image</a> website.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recent charity dinner for Lead On Cairns that I helped out at, was quite a
success.</p>

<p>The night was kept running smoothly by 4 Macs. Two of the macs (an iBook and
either a MacBook Pro or a PowerBook) were being run by the sound/lighting
guys. <a href="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/imac_3_20071026.jpg"><img src="http://mattlangtree.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/imac_3_20071026-300x180.jpg" alt="Apple iMac 20&quot; and Apple iMac 24&quot;" /></a></p>

<p>We had a 24&#8221; Aluminium iMac [in the middle of the room] feeding the projector
with the great Keynote presentation that I worked on. The keynote presentation
on the 24&#8221; iMac was also being controlled by the Apple Remote from the
presenters lectern.</p>

<p>I also had my 20&#8221; Aluminium 2.4Ghz iMac [at the back of the room] to use as
preparation for my speech. I decided that I would set up an ad-hoc wireless
network to send any last minute changes up to the 24&#8221; iMac. Instead of walking
back and forth to close and open Keynote.app I set up &#8220;Screen Sharing&#8221; on the
24&#8221; iMac, and connected to the projector machine from my iMac.</p>

<p>As a side-effect of this setup, I decided to remotely control the slide from
MY iMac as a failsafe if the remote didn&#8217;t work properly</p>

<p>This method of controlling the presentation proved to be quite successful,
considering some of the guest speakers had multiple slides.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At about 3pm on Friday, the new <a href="http://www.leadoncairns.com.au/">Lead On Cairns

<p>I have to thank the few people at
<a href="http://www.cityofcairns.com/staff.html">cityofcairns.com</a> that helped me to
get the website up and running before the Lead On Cairns <a href="http://www.leadoncairns.com.au/p.community-dinner">Community

<p>The new website can be found at <a href="http://www.leadoncairns.com.au">

<p>On sunday I took my new car out for a spin to clock up some kilometres before
my 1000km service.</p>

<p>While I was up on the tablelands I stopped off at a Mick&#8217;s place (next to
Rick&#8217;s property) for a coffee and to help him free a car that his kids had
managed to perch on an old tree stump.</p>

<p>I decided that while I was up on the tablelands I would take advantage of some
of the picturesque scenery that the Cairns Tablelands has to offer.</p>
